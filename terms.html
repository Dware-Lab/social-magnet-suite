                                    your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must
                                    destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed

                                    other warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of

                                    intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, Linkroid does not
                                    warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or

                                    jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of
                                    liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply
                                    to you.

                                    13. GDPR compliant feature: Linkroid provides a simple and easy to use mechanism for
                                    collecting European visitors consents every-time they click on any of shorten links.

                                <p>
                                    13.1. The GDPR compliant feature is only based on some basic requirements in the
                                    GDPR, it is therefore not a complete guarantee requirements set out in the GDPR.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    13.2. Linkroid is designed as a service to facilitate compliance with EU regulations
                                    concerning the use of cookies on your website and to help you obtain the relevant
                                    consents to the use of cookies from the users of your website. Linkroid is only the

                                    ensure correct implementation and provide relevant input to the system. The relevant
                                    EU legislation is not necessarily implemented in the same way in all EU countries,
                                    and we cannot guarantee that using Linkroid will automatically lead to compliance
                                    with all relevant rules and regulations concerning the use of cookies or the
                                    collection of consents to the use of cookies. We encourage you to seek local legal
                                    advice to ensure compliance with local legislation when implementing the solution on
                                    your website and to tailor the wording of the consents to be shown on your website.
                                </p>
